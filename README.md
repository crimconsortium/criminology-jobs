# Criminology Jobs Explorer

A searchable dashboard of current academic, practitioner, and trust & safety job postings in criminology, criminal justice, and closely related fields.

**Live site:** https://crimconsortium.github.io/criminology-jobs

## Sources

Postings are aggregated from publicly visible listings only — anything behind a login is excluded.

- [Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences — Careers](https://careers.acjs.org/jobs/)
- [American Society of Criminology — Career Center](https://asc41.org/career-center/position-postings/)
- [HigherEdJobs — Criminal Justice & Criminology faculty](https://www.higheredjobs.com/faculty/search.cfm?JobCat=156)
- [jobs.ac.uk — criminology search](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/search/?keywords=criminology)
- [Trust & Safety Professional Association — Job Board](https://www.tspa.org/explore/job-board/)

## Coverage

- **Roles:** faculty + research positions (tenure-track, postdocs, lecturers, professors). Adjunct, part-time pool, community-college, and pure forensic-science / homeland-security listings are filtered out.
- **Topics:** clearly criminology / criminal-justice work; generic law or sociology positions without a clear criminology component are excluded.
- **Dedup:** the same position appearing on more than one site is consolidated into a single row, with all source URLs listed.

## Data files

- `criminology_jobs.csv` — the master dataset (downloadable from the site too).
- `data.js` — same data embedded for the in-browser dashboard, with consortium-member tags applied.

## CrimConsortium

Postings from [CrimConsortium](https://crimconsortium.com) member institutions are highlighted with an orange rail and "Consortium" pill.
